	   Array                Collection

1. Fixed in size       1. Collection is growable in nature
                          Size of the collection can be increased
                          or decreased at the runtime.

2. NO built-in         2. Collection has built-in methods
   method support         to perform basic and advanced operations
                          on the group of data.

3. Don't have any      3. Every collection is built by using
   underlying DS          at least one DS



 * Collection is a group of references which is represented as One unit.

 ********** IF YOU TRY TO INSERT ANY PRIRMITIVE VALUE TO ANY COLLECTION , THEN JVM
    1. CREATES THE WRAPPER CLASS OBJECT OF CORRESPONDING DATA TYPE
    2. STORES THE ADDRESS IN THE GIVEN COLLECTION

 * Collection are of 3 types

   1. List
   2. Set
   3. Queue


   List type of Collection

   * List can store duplicates.
   * List has index.
   * List support multiple null values.
   * List preserve insertion order.


   ArrayList

   * ArrayList can store duplicates.
   * ArrayList has index.
   * ArrayList support multiple null values.
   * ArrayList preserve insertion order.

   * Resizable array is the underlying Data Structure of ArrayList.

   * Whenever ArrayList exceeds capacity, a new arraylist is
     created and all the old values are copied to new arraylist

   Constructors of ArrayList

   ArrayList()
   Constructs an empty list with an initial capacity of ten.

   ArrayList(Collection c)
   Constructs a list containing the elements
   of the specified collection.

   ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
   Constructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity.

   Methods of ArrayList

   *add()
   *
   ..

   * ArrayList implementation is not synchronized.
   * ArrayList is NOT THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an ArrayList concurrently,
     and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally,
     it will impact on other threads.

  * Whenever we have frequent read-ops then use Arraylist
  * Whenever we have frequent add/insert-ops then ArrayList should not be used
